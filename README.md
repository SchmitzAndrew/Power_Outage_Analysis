# Power Outage Characteristics In Urban and Rural Areas

## Introduction


### Our Dataset
Our dataset is information on significant power outages that took place in the continental U.S. 
The information about the power outages contains information about the region the power outages occurred, 
information about the power outage itself, and economic details from the state where the outage occurred. 

### Selected Question: Do power outages that occur in areas with high population density last longer than those that are in more sparsely populated areas?

The information in this dataset is important since it gives us a great insight into American infrastructure. This question is important because it can tell us if we are neglecting utilities' response for those in rural areas.

There are 1534 rows in our dataset and 57 columns. We used a subset of those columns to answer our question.

These columns are: YEAR, MONTH, U.S._STATE, OUTAGE.START.DATE, OUTAGE.START.TIME, 
               OUTAGE.RESTORATION.DATE, OUTAGE.RESTORATION.TIME, OUTAGE.DURATION,
               POPULATION, POPPCT_URBAN, POPDEN_URBA', POPDEN_RURAL.

- YEAR: This is the year that the power outage took place
- MONTH: The month the outage took place
- U.S. State: This is the state (contintental) took place
- START.DATE: This is the date that the outage took place
- STATE.TIME: This is the time that the power outage began
- RESTORATION.DATE: This is the date that the power was turned back on and the outage ended
- RESTORATION.TIME: This is the time in the day that the power was turned back on
- DURATION: This is the time, represented as minutes, that the power outage lasted
- POPULATION: This is the population of the U.S. state that the power outage was located in. 
- POPPCT_URBAN: The percentage of residents in that state that are URBAN. The inverse of this statistic is the amount of people that are rural.
